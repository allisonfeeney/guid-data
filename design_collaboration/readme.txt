There are three sets of files in this package - 

Rosemary Astheimers 's "NX_Plate_w_Hole" files, Revs 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 that have been annotated with additional label information on certain entities (*.LBLS_*.stp) to facilitate generation of type 5 UUIDs for those entities (see below) -

	product, pmi, certain topological entities

Above files run through Ed Paff's stepuuid2.exe utility to include UUIDs at the end of the data section (*_UUIDS_*.stp).

Above UUID files run through Ed Paff's stepuuid2.exe utility with the "-v" option to produce verification files (*_UUIDS_*_chk.txt).  These verification files confirm each UUID generated and the entity to which the UUID is assigned (either directly or indirectly).

Please contact Asa Trainer (agtrainer@comcast.net) if you have any questions.

Thanks!
