NOTE: THIS ITERATION HAS CHANGED. THE CHANGE THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY ITERATION 0.3 IS NOW 0.2
*******************************************************************************************
The original iteration was done in NX. The change was deleting a point from within a sketch that located a hole center and then adding a new point to that sketch. Creo and CATIA do not allow such changes, therefore this change was dropped.
